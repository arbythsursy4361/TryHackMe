Introduction to Defensive Security

Offensive security focuses on one thing: breaking into systems.
Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network.
IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.

Areas of Defensive Security

*Security Operations Center(SOC), where we cover Threat Intelligence.
*Digital Forensics and Incident Response(DFIR), where we also cover Malware Analysis.

Threat Intelligence
Intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies.
A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.
Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

Incident Response
Preparation(Training) -> Detection and Analysis -> Containment(stop the virus to spread), Eradication(clear the virus), and Recovery -> Post-Incident Activity
