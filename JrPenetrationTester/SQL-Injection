#1. Brief
  SQL(Structured Query Language) Injection is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed.
----------
#2. What is a Database?
  A database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organised manner. Database is controlled by a DBMS.
----------
#3. What is SQL?
  SQL is a feature-rich language used for querying databases.
  -> SELECT
  -> UNION
  -> INSERT
  -> UPDATE
  -> DELETE
----------
#4. What is SQL Injection?
  SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
----------
#5. In-Band SQLi
  In-Band SQL injection: It just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results.
  Error-Based SQL Injection: The error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen, then often be used to enumerate a
whole database.
  Union-Based SQL Injection: It utilises the UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page.

  Practical:
  Error-based SQL Injection is most commonly single apostrophes (') or a quotation mark (").

  SELECT * FROM article WHERE id = 0 UNION SELECT 1, 2, group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = database();
  The information_schema database is every user of the database has access to this, and it contains information about all the databases and tables
the user has access to.
  SELECT * FROM article WHERE id = 0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users';
----------
#6. Blind SQLi - Authentication Bypass
  Blind SQLi is when we get little to no feedback to confirm whether our injected queries were. Authentication methods such as login forms.
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='0' OR 1=1;-- AND password='' OR 1=1;
----------
#7. Blind SQLi - Boolean Based
  Boolean-based SQL Injection refers to the response we receive from our injection attempts, which could be a true/false. We get a true response
because, in the like operator, we just have the value of %, which will match anything as it's the wildcard value.
----------
#8. Blind SQLi - Time Based
  A time-based blind SQL injection is very similar to the above boolean-based one in that the same requests are sent, but there is no visual
indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time. The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT sta-
tement.
----------
#9. Out-of-Band SQLi
  It depends on specific features being enabled on the database server or the web application's business logic, which makes some kind of ex-
ternal network call based on the results from an SQL query. An Out-Of-Band attack is classified by having two different communication chann-
els, one to launch the attack and the other to gather the results.
----------
#10. Remediation
  Prepared Statements (With Parameterized Queries): The first thing a developer writes is the SQL query, and then any user inputs are added
as parameters afterwards.

  Input Validation: A string replacement method in the programming language can filter the characters you wish to allow or disallow.

  Escaping User Input: Allowing user input containing characters such as ' " $ \ can cause SQL Queries to break. Escaping user input is the
method of prepending a backslash (\) to these characters, which then causes them to be parsed just as a regular string and not a special c-
haracter.
